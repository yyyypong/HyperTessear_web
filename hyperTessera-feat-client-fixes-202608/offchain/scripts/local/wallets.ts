/**
 * Named role wallets for the local devnet, derived from anvil's standard deterministic mnemonic
 * (never used outside local testing). Indices 0-9 are anvil's default pre-funded accounts;
 * indices 10-11 are derived the same way but not pre-funded by anvil (funded manually where a
 * role needs to submit transactions — see scripts/local/deploy.ts).
 *
 * Role -> index map matches the convention already embedded in script/Deploy.s.sol's
 * `_grantDemoRoles` (ANVIL_1..ANVIL_7), extended with dedicated Settlement operator + investor
 * accounts for this local test setup. Under the Vault-local/Asset-local RBAC model, `governor`
 * deploys and remains each demo Vault's Owner; `curator`/`guardian` are then delegated the
 * Vault-local Curator/Guardian roles (see scripts/local/deploy.ts's role-wiring step, run after
 * DeployW3/DeployW4 since those forge scripts broadcast everything as `governor` for bootstrap).
